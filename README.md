# Dynamic Business Performance Forecaster: ML-Driven Predictions, Factor Prioritization, and Interactive Real-Time Scenario Planning with Natural Language Explanations
The aim of this project is to design an interactive
tool that uses machine learning(ML) for accurate forecasting, prioritizes high-impact factors,
and integrates GenAI for natural language explanations to enable users to conduct real-time
scenario simulations. This project is focused on small to medium enterprises (SMEs) to ad-
dress a lack of educational analytics platforms, prioritizing interpretability and adaptability
over enterprise-scale complexity found in tools like Tableau.
