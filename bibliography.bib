annote  = {This is a popular algorithms textbook which is well-cited. In particular, Part VI on graph algorithms will be of interest. Chapter 26 discusses flow networks and introduces commonly used notation. It formally describes the problem of obtaining a maximum flow and its equivalence to obtaining a minimum cut. The classical method of Ford and Fulkerson's algorithm for finding a maximum flow is described, and it includes several examples. Additional methods for obtaining a maximum flow, including the push-relabel method, are also described. The chapter notes include additional references to specific articles which may be helpful, such as those of historical interest (the article in which an algorithm was originally proposed) as well as state-of-the-art improvements (more recent articles to improve the approach).}

abstract = {Domestic undergraduate computer science students formally learn about machine learning and artificial intelligence in upper level undergraduate computing programs, yet they must navigate the lure of ChatGPT and other generative Artificial Intelligence tools that have been found to be somewhat accurate at completing early coding assignments. As AI tools proliferate, messaging about their use in academic settings are varied, and access to AI literacy is unknown. Through an investigation of interviews with Pell grant eligible college students at open access colleges, we address the following research questions: How do low-income undergraduate interview participants describe their uses of and attitudes regarding generative AI tool use for academic purposes? and What elements of AI digital literacy appear to be accessible to interview participants, based on their descriptive statements?},

abstract={Purpose: Business Analytics was defined as one of the most important aspects of combinations of skills, technologies and practices which scrutinize a corporation's data and performance to transpire data-driven decision-making analytics for a corporation's future direction and investment plans. In this paper, much of the focus will be given to predictive analytics, which is a branch of business analytics that scrutinize the application of input data, statistical combinations and intelligence machine learning statistics on predicting the plausibility of a particular event happening, forecast future trends or outcomes utilizing on-hand data with the final objective of improving the performance of the corporation. While it has been around for decades, predictive analytics has gained much attention in the late 20th century. This technique includes data mining and big data analytics. Last but not least, the decision tree methodology, a supervised simple classification tool for predictive analytics, is fully scrutinized below for applying predictive business analytics and decision tree in business applications. Design/ Methodology/Approach: A systematic literature review was conducted in predictive analytics and decision tree. The literature review explains various fields' latest predictive analytics and decision trees. All the research papers are obtained from two databases: Web of Science and Scopus, which are widely acknowledged by the scientific and research communities that contain top-quality peer-reviewed journals. Findings: This study reviews the application of predictive analytics and decision tree in business decision-making across various fields. Practical implications: This paper will strongly contribute to providing significant inputs to analysts or researchers in business analytics, predictive analytics and decision tree as it presents recent evidence of the applications of various fields. This review will be in the interest of academics and practitioners in business analytics, especially predictive analytics.},

abstract = {Organizational agility is key for enterprises to thrive and survive in an increasingly dynamic business environment. Past research mainly investigated organizational agility from the organizational dynamic capability and digital options perspectives. This study suggests entrepreneurial alertness is another path critical for improving organizational agility. Based on the strategic foresight literature, this study proposes that the combined use of descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive insights generated by using business intelligence and big data analytics allows firms to practice data-driven strategic foresight. We further propose that firms adopting such practice would possess higher entrepreneurial alertness, thereby, increasing their entrepreneurial and adaptive agility.},
