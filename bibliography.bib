abstract={Purpose: Business Analytics was defined as one of the most important aspects of combinations of skills, technologies and practices which scrutinize a corporation's data and performance to transpire data-driven decision-making analytics for a corporation's future direction and investment plans. In this paper, much of the focus will be given to predictive analytics, which is a branch of business analytics that scrutinize the application of input data, statistical combinations and intelligence machine learning statistics on predicting the plausibility of a particular event happening, forecast future trends or outcomes utilizing on-hand data with the final objective of improving the performance of the corporation. While it has been around for decades, predictive analytics has gained much attention in the late 20th century. This technique includes data mining and big data analytics. Last but not least, the decision tree methodology, a supervised simple classification tool for predictive analytics, is fully scrutinized below for applying predictive business analytics and decision tree in business applications. Design/ Methodology/Approach: A systematic literature review was conducted in predictive analytics and decision tree. The literature review explains various fields' latest predictive analytics and decision trees. All the research papers are obtained from two databases: Web of Science and Scopus, which are widely acknowledged by the scientific and research communities that contain top-quality peer-reviewed journals. Findings: This study reviews the application of predictive analytics and decision tree in business decision-making across various fields. Practical implications: This paper will strongly contribute to providing significant inputs to analysts or researchers in business analytics, predictive analytics and decision tree as it presents recent evidence of the applications of various fields. This review will be in the interest of academics and practitioners in business analytics, especially predictive analytics.},

annote = {This paper is a systematic review that defines Business Analytics and focuses on one of its key branches: Predictive Analytics. It explains how Predictive Analytics uses statistics and machine learning to forecast future trends. The paper also highlights the Decision Tree as a particularly user-friendly and interpretable tool for applying predictive analytics in business.

This review will be useful for the methods section of my study. It provides a clear, established definition of Predictive Analytics, which I can adopt. More importantly, I will reference its discussion of the Decision Tree methodology as a justification for potentially selecting it as a practical, interpretable analytical technique to use in my own research on business analytics applications.}

abstract = {Against the backdrop of the rapid development of digital economy and artificial intelligence technology, performance appraisal and business-finance integration (BFI) have become key issues in improving enterprise management efficiency and scientific decision-making. Traditional performance appraisal methods often have problems such as single data dimension and subjective setting of appraisal indicators, making it difficult to effectively evaluate the synergy between finance and business. To this end, this paper proposes an intelligent performance evaluation method based on generative adversarial network (GAN) to improve the intelligence level of the appraisal system. The study uses conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN) to construct a performance evaluation framework, establishes a high-dimensional performance scoring model through the collaborative input of business data and financial data, and optimizes the rationality and accuracy of the scoring results under the adversarial training mechanism. Experiments show that compared with traditional linear regression models and decision tree models, the performance appraisal scoring error generated by GAN is reduced by 18.4\%, and the performance prediction accuracy is increased by 21.7\%. This method can effectively improve the scientific nature of enterprise performance appraisal, promote the in-depth development of business-finance integration, and provide theoretical support and practical guidance for enterprise intelligent management.},

annote = {This paper addresses the challenge of evaluating business-finance integration (BFI) by proposing an advanced artificial intelligence method for performance appraisal. It critiques traditional methods (like KPIs)  for being too simplistic, subjective, or data-hungry. As a solution, it introduces a sophisticated model using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), which it shows outperforms traditional models in accuracy for scoring and predicting performance.

This paper establishes the limitations of conventional analytical approaches in a key area of business (performance appraisal and BFI). It serves as a strong example of why my study on Business Analytics needs to consider modern, complex methods. While my own research may not use a GAN, this source justifies the exploration of advanced analytics to solve intricate, multi-dimensional business problems effectively. It highlights the evolution of analytics applications.

abstract = {Organizational agility is key for enterprises to thrive and survive in an increasingly dynamic business environment. Past research mainly investigated organizational agility from the organizational dynamic capability and digital options perspectives. This study suggests entrepreneurial alertness is another path critical for improving organizational agility. Based on the strategic foresight literature, this study proposes that the combined use of descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive insights generated by using business intelligence and big data analytics allows firms to practice data-driven strategic foresight. We further propose that firms adopting such practice would possess higher entrepreneurial alertness, thereby, increasing their entrepreneurial and adaptive agility.},

annote = {This reading argues that using business analytics helps companies see future opportunities and threats better. It calls this "data-driven strategic foresight." This sharper vision increases a company’s alertness and, in turn, makes it more agile. I will use this article's main idea as a key part of my study's foundation. It provides a model (the three types of analytics leading to strategic foresight and agility) that I can reference to explain how business analytics creates real strategic value, moving beyond just better daily decisions.}
